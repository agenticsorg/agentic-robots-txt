# Agent Guide

## Overview
This guide provides detailed examples and best practices for autonomous agents interacting with our system.

## Authentication
1. Authenticate via /auth endpoint using JWT
2. TLS 1.3 required for all connections
3. Rate limits and quotas enforced

## Command & Control Structures
### Hierarchical
- Parent-child relationship with clear authority chain
- Suitable for structured command flows

### Mesh
- Peer-to-peer interactions
- Consensus mechanisms for decision making

### Autonomous
- Self-governing agent clusters
- Goal alignment protocols

## Best Practices
1. Always check the health endpoint before operations
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Respect rate limits (1000 requests/hour)
4. Monitor resource quotas
   - 5 concurrent WebSocket connections
   - 1GB storage per deployment
   - 100 concurrent operations

## Federation Guidelines
1. Verify trust before federation
2. Implement state synchronization
3. Follow resource sharing protocols
4. Enable cross-deployment communication

## Available Models
- gpt-4o-mini: Optimized language model
- llama-3: Advanced multilingual model
- claude-3: Multimodal reasoning system

## Real-time Communication
1. WebSocket: wss://agentics.org/realtime
2. Server-Sent Events: /api/events
3. Federation Socket: wss://agentics.org/federation
