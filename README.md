# Agentic_Robots.txt Specification

## Empowering the Next Generation of Web Automation

Agentic_Robots.txt revolutionizes how autonomous agents interact with web applications by extending the traditional robots.txt protocol into a comprehensive framework for programmatic discovery and interaction. This specification bridges the gap between static web crawling and dynamic, intelligent agent interactions.

## Why Agentic_Robots.txt?

- üîç **Smart Discovery**: Autonomous agents can dynamically discover and understand application capabilities
- ü§ù **Seamless Integration**: Standardized protocols for agent-application communication
- üåê **Federation Ready**: Built-in support for cross-deployment coordination
- üîí **Enterprise Security**: Advanced authentication and authorization framework
- ‚ö° **Real-time Enabled**: Native support for WebSocket and event-based communication
- üìä **Observable**: Comprehensive health monitoring and metrics

## Core Protocol Features

### Discovery Chain
The specification implements a hierarchical discovery mechanism that allows agents to progressively explore and understand application capabilities:

```
robots.txt ‚Üí manifest.json ‚Üí capability files
```

### Communication Channels
Multiple communication methods support diverse interaction patterns:
- RESTful API endpoints for standard request-response
- WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication
- Server-Sent Events for system updates and notifications

### Security Model
Enterprise-grade security features:
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting and request validation
- TLS encryption with key rotation

### Federation Support
Built-in distributed coordination capabilities:
- Automatic peer discovery
- Resource sharing and load distribution
- State synchronization
- Trust verification

## Implementation Requirements

### Mandatory Features
- Extended robots.txt directives
- .well-known directory structure
- JSON schema validation
- HTTP/2 support
- WebSocket capabilities
- JWT authentication

### Optional Enhancements
- Federation protocol support
- Custom capability definitions
- Advanced monitoring systems
- Version control integration
