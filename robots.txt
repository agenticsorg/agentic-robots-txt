# Agentic Robots.txt - Autonomous Agent Guidance System
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2025-02-13

# Quick Start Guide for Autonomous Agents:
# 1. Read the manifest at /.well-known/agentics-manifest.json for complete capabilities
# 2. See /.well-known/agent-guide.md for detailed examples and best practices
# 3. Authenticate via /auth endpoint using JWT
# 4. Access real-time updates via WebSocket
# 5. Join federation network if distributed operations needed

# Structured Specifications:
# - Main Manifest:     /.well-known/agentics-manifest.json    # Complete system overview and entry points
# - Agent Guide:       /.well-known/agent-guide.md           # Detailed examples and best practices
# - Agent Guidance:    /.well-known/agentic-guidance.json     # Core interaction specifications
# - API Docs:          /.well-known/openapi.json              # REST API documentation
# - WebSocket:         /.well-known/asyncapi.json             # Real-time capabilities
# - Federation:        /.well-known/peers.json                # Distributed deployment coordination
# - Health Status:     /.well-known/health.json              # System health and monitoring
# - Model Specs:       /.well-known/models.json              # AI model capabilities

# Command & Control Structures Available:
# - Hierarchical: Parent-child relationship with clear authority chain
# - Mesh: Peer-to-peer interactions with consensus mechanisms
# - Autonomous: Self-governing agent clusters with goal alignment

# Security Requirements:
# - Authentication required for all API access
# - TLS 1.3 required for all connections
# - Federation requires trust verification
# - Rate limits and quotas enforced

# Standard Crawler Directives
